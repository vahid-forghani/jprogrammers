This website is only made by [`Typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or let's say [`Javascript`](https://www.javascript.com/).
<br/>
For the backe-end part it uses [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) and the powerful [`Express.js`](https://expressjs.com/) framework, to store data, it uses [`MongoDB`](https://www.mongodb.com/) and takes advantage of [`Mongoose.js`](https://mongoosejs.com/) to connect to it and use it.
<br/>
For the client part, it uses [`Angular`](https://angular.io/) and [`Angular Material`](https://material.angular.io/) design to make it more beautiful. To show codes in a beautiful way it uses [`Prism.js`](https://prismjs.com/)
